# Simon Says Game Project

Welcome to the "Simon-says" repository! This project was undertaken as a practice endeavor to solidify my knowledge of front-end development, with a strong focus on JavaScript. The primary goal of this project was to create a digital version of the classic Simon Says memory game, helping users enhance their memory and cognitive skills in an engaging manner.

## Project Overview

The "Simon-says" project entails the development of a digital Simon Says game. In this classic game, users are presented with a sequence of colors that they must replicate in the correct order. With each successful replication, the sequence becomes progressively longer, providing an ever-increasing challenge.
